This is the front_end of the online chating website made by me using HTML,CSS , JS , Node js and web socket..
As this is hosted on netlify and render , the page on the render gets terminated after some times of initiating it.
So, it might not work always 
I need to re-start the page again due to use of unpaid service on render...
But you can have a feel of the site through
